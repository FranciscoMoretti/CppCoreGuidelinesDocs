# <a href="#" name="S-unclassified"></a>To-do: Unclassified proto-rules

This is our to-do list.
Eventually, the entries will become rules or parts of rules.
Alternatively, we will decide that no change is needed and delete the entry.

* No long-distance friendship

* Should physical design (what's in a file) and large-scale design (libraries, groups of libraries) be addressed?

* Namespaces

* Avoid using directives in the global scope (except for std, and other "fundamental" namespaces (e.g. experimental))

* How granular should namespaces be? All classes/functions designed to work together and released together (as defined in Sutter/Alexandrescu) or something narrower or wider?

* Should there be inline namespaces (à la `std::literals::*_literals`)?

* Avoid implicit conversions

* Const member functions should be thread safe ... aka, but I don't really change the variable, just assign it a value the first time it's called ... argh

* Always initialize variables, use initialization lists for member variables.

* Anyone writing a public interface which takes or returns `void*` should have their toes set on fire. That one has been a personal favorite of mine for a number of years. :)

* Use `const`-ness wherever possible: member functions, variables and (yippee) `const_iterators`

* Use `auto`

* `(size)` vs. `{initializers}` vs. `{Extent{size}}`

* Don't overabstract

* Never pass a pointer down the call stack

* falling through a function bottom

* Should there be guidelines to choose between polymorphisms? YES. classic (virtual functions, reference semantics) vs. Sean Parent style (value semantics, type-erased, kind of like `std::function`)  vs. CRTP/static? YES Perhaps even vs. tag dispatch?

* should virtual calls be banned from ctors/dtors in your guidelines? YES. A lot of people ban them, even though I think it's a big strength of C++ that they are ??? -preserving (D disappointed me so much when it went the Java way). WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE?

* Speaking of lambdas, what would weigh in on the decision between lambdas and (local?) classes in algorithm calls and other callback scenarios?

* And speaking of `std::bind`, Stephen T. Lavavej criticizes it so much I'm starting to wonder if it is indeed going to fade away in future. Should lambdas be recommended instead?

* What to do with leaks out of temporaries? : `p = (s1 + s2).c_str();`

* pointer/iterator invalidation leading to dangling pointers:

  ```cpp
    void bad()
    {
        int* p = new int[700];
        int* q = &p[7];
        delete p;

        vector<int> v(700);
        int* q2 = &v[7];
        v.resize(900);

        // ... use q and q2 ...
    }
  ```

* LSP

* private inheritance vs/and membership

* avoid static class members variables (race conditions, almost-global variables)

* Use RAII lock guards (`lock_guard`, `unique_lock`, `shared_lock`), never call `mutex.lock` and `mutex.unlock` directly (RAII)

* Prefer non-recursive locks (often used to work around bad reasoning, overhead)

* Join your threads! (because of `std::terminate` in destructor if not joined or detached ... is there a good reason to detach threads?) -- ??? could support library provide a RAII wrapper for `std::thread`?

* If two or more mutexes must be acquired at the same time, use `std::lock` (or another deadlock avoidance algorithm?)

* When using a `condition_variable`, always protect the condition by a mutex (atomic bool whose value is set outside of the mutex is wrong!), and use the same mutex for the condition variable itself.

* Never use `atomic_compare_exchange_strong` with `std::atomic<user-defined-struct>` (differences in padding matter, while `compare_exchange_weak` in a loop converges to stable padding)

* individual `shared_future` objects are not thread-safe: two threads cannot wait on the same `shared_future` object (they can wait on copies of a `shared_future` that refer to the same shared state)

* individual `shared_ptr` objects are not thread-safe: different threads can call non-`const` member functions on *different* `shared_ptr`s that refer to the same shared object, but one thread cannot call a non-`const` member function of a `shared_ptr` object while another thread accesses that same `shared_ptr` object (if you need that, consider `atomic_shared_ptr` instead)

* rules for arithmetic
