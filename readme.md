>"Within C++ is a smaller, simpler, safer language struggling to get out."
>-- <cite>Bjarne Stroustrup</cite>

The [C++ Core Guidelines](CppCoreGuidelines.md) are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result of many
person-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but
they can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs.
